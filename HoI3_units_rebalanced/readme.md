These units may be the same for some mods.

Change Log:

A) All land units:
  1) reduce air attack to 0.02 (execpt anti-air units) to improve power of aircaft.
  2) add penalties (if not present) to urban warfare to increase difficulty / time to take cities
  3) balance other terrain penalties to a lesser degree (they were present for some untis but not other by default which seemed odd)
  
B) All air units:
  1) increase range by 2/3, I find the default range to be too restrictive
  
C) All sea units:
  1) decrease build time by 3/5 except for transports (excessive build time reduces playability)
  2) increase battleship and super heavy battleship by an additional 50 days (battleship now matches carrier)
  3) range standardized to 3000

Additional reduction in air and sea unit build time to match light armor -> super heavy armor build time range.
