Change Log:

A) Naval Technology
  
  1) add super heavy battleships to capital_ship_armament, battleship_engine, battleship_armor research categories (why were they left out?)
  2) add sea plane carrier to carrier_engine, carrier_armor, large_warship_radar
  
 B) Naval Doctrines
 
 1) add sea plane carrier to carrier_group_doctrine, carrier_crew_training
 2) All surface ships now benefit from radar training (previously only carriers, which seems odd... why not train everyone?)
 

Planned Changes:

A) Naval Technology

1) allow ships to be upgraded?  Land and air units allow upgrades which are equally unrelalistic... why not sea units?
